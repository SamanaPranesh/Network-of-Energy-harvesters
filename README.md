# Network-of-Energy-harvesters
This repository consists of C++ code with OpenMP parallelisation to simulate a network of electro-magnetic energy harvesters coupled in a ring manner.
Algorithm for p% of links removal from the adjacency matrix is also implemented.
The reader may refer to the manuscript for the system of ODEs which is under study. The code can be used for other complex networks like Random networks, Small-world networks etc. by changing the adjacency matrix appropriately. 

## Algorithm
For the numerical simulations, the coupled non-dimensional governing equations are numerically integrated   
using $4$-th order Runge-Kutta time marching algorithm.

### Output of the code
The reader may modify the output file name.
The code outputs ```degree of each node ```, ```forcing frequency``` and ```power harvested per each node``` in the network.
