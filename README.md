# Network-of-Energy-harvesters
This repository consists of C++ code with OpenMP parallelisation to simulate a network of electro-magnetic energy harvesters coupled in a ring manner.
The reader may refer to the manuscript for the system of ODEs which is under study. 

## Algorithm
For the numerical simulations, the coupled non-dimensional governing equations are numerically integrated   
using $4$-th order Runge-Kutta time marching algorithm.

### Output of the code
The reader may modify the output file name.
The code outputs ```degree of each node ```, ```forcing frequency``` and ```power harvested per each node``` in the network.
